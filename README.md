## Dataset Description
The dataset used is taken from Netflix Prize Challenge. 
	- A short sample of the Movies and their numbers are extracted in a file called 'movie_title.txt'
	- A short-listed file excepted as follows:
		Each file contains of the customer-IDs, the movie-IDs and ranking score.
		Customer-IDs range from 1 tp 2649429, with gaps. There are 480189 users.
		Movie-IDs range from 1 to 17770 sequentially.
		Rating are on a five start scale(integal) from 1 to 5
## Data Preprocessing 
	Preprocess the original dataset in following two steps:
	- Change the data in each movie file into the following format: User-ID, Movie-ID and Rating-score.
## Building Steps :
	- Divide data by User-ID
	- Build co-occurence matrix 
	- Normalize co-occurence matrix 
	- Build rating matrix 
	- Multiply co-occurrence matrix and rating matrix 
	- Generate recommender list 

## How to run 
```
hadoop com.sun.tools.javac.Main *.java
jar cf recommender.jar *.class
hadoop jar recommender.jar Driver /input /dataDividedByUser /coOccurrenceMatrix /Normalize /Multiplication /Sum
hdfs dfs -cat /Sum/*
```
